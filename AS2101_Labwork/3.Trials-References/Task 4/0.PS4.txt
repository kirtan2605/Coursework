Quadrature.
|---> historically - determine area
|---> express solution in terms in integral
|---> numerical analysis : approximation of def. integral of a function

	I = int(a,b) [f(x).dx] = sum(i) [f(x_i).w_i]
	
Simple Integration:
	I = int(a,b) [f(x).dx]
find using:
	1.Rectangular Rule --->(ONLY Left Endpoint,ONLY Right Endpoint,ONLY Midpoint)
	2.Trapezoid Rule --->(uses both Left and Right endpoint)
